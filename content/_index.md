## Hello!




I am a Labor Economist at  the [Institute of Labor Economics (IZA)](https://www.iza.org/). Before moving to IZA, I worked at the [Institute for Employment Research (IAB)](https://iab.de/en/startseite-english/), where I still hold a research position. My work focuses on how different aspects of unemployment insurance, tax- and transfer schemes and personalized labor market policies affect labor supply, program take-up and other outcomes.


Here is [my CV](https://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/personnel/vitae/24066_cv.pdf). 

Please get in touch if you would like to talk about your or my research!   [trenkle@iza.org](mailto:trenkle@iza.org)
