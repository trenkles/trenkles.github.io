## Hello!


I am a Labor Economist and [my research](https://trenkles.github.io/research/) focuses on how Labor Market Policies- and Institutions operate in a frictional labor market and how these affect worker outcomes and inequality. I also work on how workers are affected by job-loss, and search for a new job during unemployment.

I’m employed at the [Institute of Labor Economics (IZA)](https://www.iza.org/), and hold a part time position at the [Institute for Employment Research (IAB)](https://iab.de/en/startseite-english/). I’m a member of the CRC TR-224 between the Universities Bonn and Mannheim.

My work often uses large administrative data sets, sometimes merged with survey data. I have also been directly involved in the collection of novel survey data and the creation of new admin data. I often use quasi experimental methods, sometimes in combination with structural methods, but I’m also a fan of careful descriptive work. 

Here is [my CV](https://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/personnel/vitae/24066_cv.pdf)! 

Please get in touch if you would like to talk about your or my research! trenkle@iza.org [trenkle@iza.org](mailto:trenkle@iza.org)
