## Hello!


I am a Labor Economist. In [my research](https://trenkles.github.io/research/) I focus on how Labor Market Policies- and Institutions operate in a frictional labor market and how these affect labor market outcomes and inequality. I also work on how workers are affected by job-loss, and search for a new job during unemployment.

I’m employed at the [Institute of Labor Economics (IZA)](https://www.iza.org/), and hold a part time position at the [Institute for Employment Research (IAB)](https://iab.de/en/startseite-english/). I’m a member of the CRC TR-224 between the Universities Bonn and Mannheim.


Here is [my CV](https://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/personnel/vitae/24066_cv.pdf)! 

Please get in touch if you would like to talk about your or my research! [trenkle@iza.org](mailto:trenkle@iza.org)
